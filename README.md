This project is a simple web application built using REACT.js.

Application  displays the weather forecast for the current day and the next 5 days.

You can search by cities from around the world, autocomplete in the search field helps you with it.

The data for the weather forecast are based on the Open Weather Map API (https://openweathermap.org/api)  and the list of cities comes from their included json file http://bulk.openweathermap.org/sample/.

The result of the search is then clearly compiled on the display into a list sorted by  individual days and 3 hour intervals.

---------------


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The application is divided into individual components - while the search result - the SelectCity component passes information about the chosen city by user, and the Row and RowList components then render the weather forecast for each day in the main Application - App.js Component.

You can download the repository file into your computer and then - by running the "npm install" and "npm start"  you can watch the app in the development mode (in http://localhost:3000).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
